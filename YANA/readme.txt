Download all these and run with npm install. 
Both back end and front end.
Then run backend with node server.js
frontend with ionic serve
after ionic project opens with the browser go to inspect
then choose the phone as iphone X
Dont change anything in back end or front end just give me a call
there cannot be any errors

we need to add the add records page to this.then delete record option and the edit user details options
then we are done the project.

good luck!
